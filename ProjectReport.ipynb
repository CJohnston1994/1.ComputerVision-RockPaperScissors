    "# Task 1 - Create an image project model with 4 different classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing\n",
    "Creating the model was a little bit of a challenge for something so seemingly simple. I tested different advanced settings in the beginning and ended up with 2 different models that were both having trouble differentiating between the Paper and scissors classes. Finally I settled on a model with fewer images, but that was giving more certain results. This had around 70-120 images per class. I was debaiting having more images and incorperating different hand shapes per class, e.g paper with fingers closed vs spread, but this seemed unnceessarily complicated. As a base model this will be perfect, but I would Like to come back later and create a more refined model  that does include these features\n",

    "This task was rather easy though I made the mistake of acting before I had read the task and installed the dependencies before I created the environment. I've never worked with virtual environments in such a way before so I was unsure of what to expect, but it makes basic sense without looking too deep into it for now. It is very helpful for instancing environment to run codde with specific demendencies and allows the prevention of possible clashes or issues with other packages, or allows the use of older packages than are installed or newer packages to test if updating is viable.\n",

The prediction is then printed to the output in 4 different values corresponding to the classes of the training set: Rock, Paper, Scissors and None. finally the program does this until it is cloeed with the 'q' key, triggering the if statement which leads to a break. or by terminating the program in the IDE. once the while loop is exited via the break the image capture is released and the window is closed.\n",
